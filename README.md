# ML-Tensorflow
Different machine learning algorithms implemented in Jupyter Notebook

I will keep uploading new files as I keep working with different tensors.
Most of these are pretty basic and utilize the same fundamentals. Just some tweaking here and there and most of the Datasets on tensorflow can be computed.
I advice scouring the internet for any kind of details required in any machine learning algorithm.

Some innovation along with regular practice and dedication will eventually lead to you making a face-recognition software. It isn't all that hard.
And that's just the beginning!
